Welcome to the Roster App!

This app was created to help me plan my time better with friends and family. As a bus driver, my work schedule is chaotic and often leads to me making plans on days I’m supposed to be working. After disappointing my loved ones one too many times, I decided to develop an app that would help me stay on top of my schedule.

The Problem

As a bus driver, I receive a roster that outlines my work schedule for the entire year. At first glance, this seems helpful, but the system is frustratingly complex. Whenever a friend or family member asks if I'm free on a particular day, I face the tedious task of deciphering my availability.

Here’s how it works:

Identify the Line Number: First, I need to find my current line number on the roster.
Calculate the Target Week: Then, I count the number of weeks between today and the day in question. Adding this number to my current line number gives me the target line number.
Locate the Week Line: With the target line number in hand, I have to look up the corresponding week on the roster, which lists my duties from Sunday to Saturday—not Monday to Sunday like most rosters.
For example, if I’m on line 3801 for a particular week, my schedule might look something like this:

Line, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Total.

3801, 4510, 528, 434, 443, 402, RD, RD, paid time: 38.55

Consulting the roster is the only way to know if I’m free on a specific day, but the process is cumbersome and prone to error.

The App's Purpose

Stage One of the app aims to simplify this process, minimizing the risk of human error. Stage Two and Three will focus on integrating other parts of this convoluted schedule, like duties and running boards, into a single, easy-to-access platform.

Understanding the Schedule

To fully grasp my schedule, I need to piece together several components:

The Roster: A detailed table listing duties for each day, depending on my line number.
The Duties Board: An even longer table that specifies which bus routes I’ll be driving, the timing, and the running boards to follow.
The Running Boards: These outline the specific variations of routes I’ll be driving and include all the timing points.
Each number in the day columns of the roster corresponds to a duty. Once I know my duties, I have to check the Duties Board to determine which bus routes I'll be driving and refer to one of the four running board binders to see the exact route variations and timing.

This app is designed to bring all these pieces together, streamlining my ability to know when I’m working and when I’m free, so I can plan my life without the headache.
