Hello and welcome!

Introduction
This app was designed to help me in the making of plans with friends and family. My work roster is a big mess which has caused me to make plans on days i am working.
After letting friends and familey down one too many times, i decided to make an app that makes sure i know when i am working and when i am not.

The problem
As a bus driver i am given a roster that covers everyday of the year for every year to come until there are changes to the roster. Which sounds great at first unbtil you learn how 
'Janky' the system is.
I dread the times when a friend or family member asks me if im free on a perticular day. To find out if i am i first have to aquire my current line number.
I then get the current date and count the number of weeks inbetween the current date and the date i want to check. I add the number of weeks to my current line number
to get my target line number. I then find that line number on the long roster table to find the week line that contains the day i want to find.
The roster will then state the duties i will be working that week starting from Sunday to Saturday. Not monday to sunday like a normal roster. This problem alone has tripped me up 
more times than i care to mention.

Say one week i will be on line 3801 so when i find this line number, i find my schedule for that week.

Line, Sunnday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Total.
3801, 4510,    528,    434,     443,       402,      RD,     RD,       paid time: 38.55

Consulting the roster is enough to tell a person if i am free on a perticular day or not. 
So stage one of the app should be to simplify this process and remove the chances of human errors. Stage Two and Three could be bringing together more parts of the 'janky' schedule.
Perhabs bring in the duties and runningboards into one place for ease of access.

To understand my schedule, there are several pieces to the puzzel:
The roster, which is a long table that states which duties are for each day depending on your line number.
The Duties board is a table much longer than the roster which tells you what bus routes you are doing at what times and what running boards you will be adheering to.
The running boards tell you what 'variation' of the routes you are doing and what times you are doing them. including all of your timing points.

Each number in the 'day' columns is a duty. Once i know what duties i am working i have to consult the 'Duty' table to know what bus routes i will be driving and what running boards i will be adheering to.
So i then have to check one of the four 'running board' binders to know what route 'variation' i will be driving and at what times.
